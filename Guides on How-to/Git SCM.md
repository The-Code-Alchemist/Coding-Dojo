# Git SCM Summary and Shortcuts
##  [A brief introduction to Git for beginners | Kedasha Kerr for GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8jQ9hVA2qs)
   -  A version control is a system that tracks changes to files over a period of time. 
     - Git is the most widely used version control system today (industry standard)
   1. The working directory is where you make changes to your files such as a workspace.
     - Holds the current state of your project
   2. The staging area or index is where you prepare your changes before committing them. 
      -  Think of it a draft space that allows you to review and adjust the changes before they become part of the project's history.
        - In other words, where the changes are not definitive yet
   3. A local repository is your project's history stored on your computer including commits and branches acting as a personal record of the project's changes. 
   4. A remote repository is a version of your project hosted on the internet (such as GitHub) or a network.
        - Allows multiple people such as an entire Scrum Team to collaborate by:
            - Pushing changes to the shared resource
            - Pulling changes from the shared resource
   5. Branches are parallel versions of your project where you can work on different features or fixes independently without affecting the main project.
      - until you're ready to merge back into them.
   6. A Pull Request (PR) is a way to propose changes from one branch to another.
      - A request to review, discuss and possibly merge the changes into the target branch
        - Often used in team collaborations
   7. Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another.
      -  It combines the histories of both branches which creates a single, unified history

- A Git GUI can give a more visual overview of your changes
## Git and GitHub are not the same
1. Git is a version control system that tracks file changes.
2. GitHub is a platform that allows developers to collaborate and store their code in the cloud.
N.B. Git can GitHub work together to make building, securing and storing software much easier.
