   - A version control is a system that tracks changes to files over a period of time.
     - The working directory is where you make changes to your files such as a workspace.
     - The staging area or index is where you prepare your changes before committing them.
         - Think of it a draft space that allows you to review and adjust the changes before they become part of the project's history
             - In other words, where the changes are not definitive yet
     - A local repository is your project's history stored on your computer including commits and branches acting as a personal record of the project's changes
     - A remote repository is a version of your project hosted on the internet such as GitHub or a network.
         - Allows multiple people such as an entire Scrum Team to collaborate by:
             - Pushing to the shared resource
             - Pulling from the shared resource
     - Branches are parallel versions of your project where you can work on different features or fixes independently without affecting the main project
