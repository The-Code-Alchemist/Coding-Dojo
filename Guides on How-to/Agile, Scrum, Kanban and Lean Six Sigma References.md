## Waterfall
- [Waterfall Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) is a linear and sequential software development process.
  - It consists of distinct phases such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
  - Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next, and there is little room for changes once a phase is completed.
  - The Waterfall Model is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal changes expected during development.
