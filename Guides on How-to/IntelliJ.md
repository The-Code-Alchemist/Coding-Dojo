# IntelliJ Summary and Shortcuts
1. Right-click on the root directory of your project folder and press `F4` to open the project settings.
   - Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl + Alt + S` to open Intellij's general settings.
   - This will open the project settings window where you can configure various aspects of your project, such as the JDK version, libraries, and modules.
   - You can also access the project settings by selecting `File` from the top menu, then `Project Structure`.
   - This is an easy way to make sure you have the correct JDK version selected for your project.
2. Some of the things you can do in the project settings:
   - You can also change the JDK version here if needed, e.g., when upgrading to a newer version of Java.
   - You can also add or remove libraries and modules from your project.
   - You can also configure the project structure, such as source and resource directories, test directories, and output directories.
   - You can also set up version control integration, such as Git or SVN, to manage your project's source code.
   - You can also configure the build tools, such as Maven or Gradle, to manage your project's dependencies and build process.
   - You can also set up code style and formatting preferences, such as indentation, line length, and naming conventions.
   - You can also configure the inspection and code analysis settings to help you identify and fix potential issues in your code.
3. Select `View` from the top menu, then `Tool Windows`, and then `Terminal` to open the terminal window.
   - Alternatively, you can press `Alt + F12` to open the terminal window.
   - Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open another terminal if your current terminal is already in use.
   - You can also use the terminal to run Maven commands such as `mvn clean install` or `mvn package`.
4. Select `Run`, then `Edit Configurations` to open the run configurations window.
   - This is where you can configure how your application will be run, including the main class, program arguments, and VM options.
   - You can also create multiple run configurations for different scenarios, such as running tests or debugging.
