# Alternative IDEs: The Developer's Alternative Workshops
## Introduction
- The Coding Dojo focuses on:
    - Open Source Software Development
    - Platform Independence (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    - A framework-agnostic approach to learning DevOps Engineering.

## 1. Use any IDE to suit your personal preferences
- Although IntelliJ is strongly recommended as the goto IDE for most Java developers, it is not recommended as the ONLY option for software development.
- Feel free to use any IDE to develop your code, just keep in mind that it supports:
  - A programming language such as Java
  - Maven
  - Git
  - Databases
- The following IDEs are also suitable for developing Java code in addition to IntelliJ
    -  [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/)
    -  [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html)
    -  [JDeveloper](https://www.oracle.com/nl/application-development/technologies/jdeveloper.html)
    -  [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/)
    -  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    -  [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    -  [Windsurf](https://www.windsurfing.com/)
    -  There's a lot more out there!
- I'd recommend knowing at least one more IDE in addition to IntelliJ.
  - That way you can see how other major IDEs work and approach software development differently.
